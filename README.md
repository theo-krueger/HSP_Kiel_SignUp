# Uni Kiel HSP Sign Up

Small script to automatically sign up for the sports programmes at Uni Kiel.

Currently, the maximum number of courses that can be automatically signed up for is one, 
but I am working on a version with unlimited signups. It is very difficult, so maybe I will 
not be able to manage. This is an early version with very little testing, so if you encounter 
bugs or unexpected behaviour, please either create an issue or send me a mail to _theokrueger.marbio@gmail.com_. 
Thank you!

Anyways, good luck! No guarantees :D

## Use
Please make sure to have [python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed and 
install the requirements through the command line:  
&nbsp;`pip install -r "Location_of_files"/requirements.txt`.

There are currently two available methods. The easier one to use is the interface if you are not familiar 
with the command line.

### Command line version:
1. Fill in the details in Entry_data.py
2. Run from the terminal:  
&nbsp;`python "Location_of_files"/cmdl_version/Signup.py`. 
### Interface version:
1. Run from the terminal:  
&nbsp;`python "Location_of_files"/gui_version/Signupper.py`
